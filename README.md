# Heatmap Consistency Planner

The **Heatmap Consistency Planner** is a web-based productivity tool inspired by GitHub’s contribution heatmap. It helps users track daily consistency and productivity through a visual calendar and a day-wise task planner.

Each day is represented as a color-coded block whose intensity reflects the level of task completion, enabling users to analyze habits and maintain discipline over time.
